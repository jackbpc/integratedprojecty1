From tigers in India to lions in Africa, humans have hunted them down and encroached on their habitat. Recently, another major threat has emerged in Africa: animals at the top of the food chain are running out of prey. Herds of impala, wildebeest, kudu and other large herbivores are in decline across sub-Saharan Africa, in part due to rising levels of poaching by hunters seeking bushmeat for subsistence and profit. A recent study found that poachers in Botswana\'s Okavango Delta were killing the equivalent of more than 15,000 impala every year. In Zambia, scientists have now documented both the toll this is taking on predators and found promising evidence it can be addressed at least in part by cracking down on poaching.</p><p>?Even in a huge, unfenced ecosystem that?s already heavily affected by humans, we can reverse the decline by increasing the investment in protection?we just need the will to do it,? said Scott Creel, a Montana State University ecologist who has spent years studying predators in this part of the world. Creel?s work tracking African wild dogs shows, in detail, the way a shortage of prey can deplete a highly endangered predator. For years, it was thought that one of the biggest threats to these large-eared dogs was their larger rivals, such as lions and hyenas. Hyenas, which are twice the size of the dogs, will steal a carcass from them. Lions will kill the dogs outright. In the late 90s, Creel wrote a paper stating that ?wild dogs are rarely limited by prey availability.?
